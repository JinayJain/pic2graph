# Pic2Graph

Converts raw images into Desmos graphs

## Usage

1. Navigate to [the application](https://jinayjain.github.io/pic2graph/) and upload your image
    * The graph generation works best with **PNG images that have many straight lines** (i.e. pixel art or small PNGs)
2. If the box next to "Upload Image" displays "Image too complex!" then you must either resize your image or choose a less complex one
3. Once your graph generation has completed, select all the text in the textbox and copy it (Ctrl-A & Ctrl-C)
4. Head over to [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) and hit Ctrl-V to paste your lines into the graph.
5. Wait till your graph has fully rendered and behold the glorious result!
